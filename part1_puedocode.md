Define the problem:
During PCR, the orginal DNA is duplicated MANY times. But, we want the numbers we analyze to be based on original numbers in the sample, not duplications. So, our goal is to remove all PCR duplicates and retain only a single copy of each read. 


Write examples:

  Include a properly formatted input sam file (an example sam file is included in the repo for your reference)
  Include a properly formatted expected output sam file
  Cover several different cases of things that are and are not PCR duplicates
  It may be helpful to create a "unit test folder", that contains it's own readme.md describing the test cases in your unit test samfile

Develop your algorithm using pseudocode

Determine high level functions

  Description
  Function headers
  Test examples (for individual functions)
  Return statement
